# firedux
> Firebase + Redux for ReactJS

Wraps the [Firebase JavaScript API](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/api/)
to dispatch Redux actions
that optimisically & immediately read/write to an in-memory
subset of your data from Firebase,
then asynchronously pull & push data in the background.

## Install

```
npm i --save firedux
```

You'll need to configure `redux-thunk` on your Redux store. 

## Use

Pending further documentation, see example usage in `test/index.js`.
